### My Udacity DAND Experience

I was asked by my session lead at Udacity to elaborate on how I finished a four and a half month course in a month and a half. So I decided to make a web zine that explains it all in a few points. Hopefully, it'll help others in their journey. However, in addition to the points mentioned in the zine, I'd like to add that I didn't have a ton of other commitments besides Udacity and that I'm incredibly grateful to have had my family's support throughout.
